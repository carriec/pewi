<h1>Introduction</h1>
<aside>Before we get to the specifics of the science model, I thought it’d be helpful to put things in context a bit, by discussing some of the background on PE/WI. That way, you’ll have a better sense of the <i>why</i> and not just the <i>how</i>.</aside>

<h1 class="double">Visualizing <span class="green">Land Use </span>& <span class="purple">Outcomes</span></h1>
<h2>Human land-use decisions drive agricultural and environmental outcomes.</h2>
<aside>PE/WI is a game-based learning tool that simulates agricultural land use in a watershed. A central tenet is learning associations between land uses and outcomes.</aside>
